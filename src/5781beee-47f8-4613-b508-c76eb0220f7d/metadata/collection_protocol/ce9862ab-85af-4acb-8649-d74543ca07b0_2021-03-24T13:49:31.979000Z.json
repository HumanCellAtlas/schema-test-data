Controls were recruited among hospital staff attending Addenbrooke\u2019s serology screening programme, and selected to cover the whole age spectrum of COVID-19 positive study participants, across both genders. Only controls with negative serology results (45 out of 47) were subsequently included in the study. Recruitment of inpatients at Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital and Health Care Workers was undertaken by the NIHR Cambridge Clinical Research Facility outreach team and the NIHR BioResource research nurse team. Ethical approval was obtained from the East of England \u2013 Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee (\u201cNIHR BioResource\u201d REC ref 17/EE/0025, and \u201cGenetic variation AND Altered Leukocyte Function in health and disease - GANDALF\u201d REC ref 08/H0308/176). All participants provided informed consent.
