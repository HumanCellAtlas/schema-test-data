Each stained sample was passed through an LS column (Miltenyi Biotec) and rinsed with Binding buffer (Miltenyi Biotec) before centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in Wash buffer and counted for CITE-seq antibody staining."}, "method": {"text": "cell size selection", "ontology": "EFO:0009337", "ontology_label": "cell size selection"}, "maximum_size": 30.0, "provenance": {"document_id": "264ab291-64ed-47f6-ae7d-45b672993720", "submission_date": "2021-03-24T13:49:32.015Z", "update_date": "2021-03-24T13:49:39.393Z", "schema_major_version": 3, "schema_minor_version": 1}}
