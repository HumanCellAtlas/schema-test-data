        "protocol_description": "Peripheral whole blood was collected in EDTA tubes and processed fresh via Ficoll-Paque Plus separation (GE healthcare,17144002). The blood was first diluted with 5 ml 2 mM EDTA-PBS (Invitrogen, 1555785-038), before 10-20 ml of diluted blood was carefully layered onto 15 ml of Ficoll in a 50mL falcon tube. If the sample volume was less than 5 ml, blood was diluted with an equal volume of EDTA-PBS and layered onto 3 ml Ficoll. The sample was centrifuged at 800 g for 20 min at room temperature. The plasma layer was carefully removed and the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) layer collected using sterile Pasteur pipette. The PBMC layer was washed with 3 volumes of EDTA-PBS by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min. The pellet was suspended in EDTA-PBS and centrifuged again at 300 g for 5 min. The PBMC pellet was collected and the cell number and viability being assessed using Trypan blue. Cell freezing medium (90% FBS, 10% DMSO) was added dropwise to PBMCs slowly on ice and then the mixture was cryopreserved at -80 \u00ac\u221eC until further full sample processing.",
