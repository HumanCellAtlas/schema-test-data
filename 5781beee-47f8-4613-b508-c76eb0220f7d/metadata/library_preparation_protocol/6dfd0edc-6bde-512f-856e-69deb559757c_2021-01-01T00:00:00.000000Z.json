        "protocol_description": "Frozen PBMC samples were thawed quickly in a water bath at 37 \u00ac\u221eC. Warm RPMI1640 medium (20-30 ml) containing 10% FBS was added slowly to the cells before centrifuging at 300 g for 5 mins, the pellet was then washed with 5 ml RPMI1640-FBS and centrifuged again (300 g for 5 mins). The PBMC pellet was collected and cell number and viability determined using Trypan blue. PBMCs from four different donors were then pooled together at equal numbers (1.25x105 PBMCs from each donor) to make up 5.0x105 cells in total. The remaining cells were used for DNA extraction (Qiagen, 69504). The pooled PBMCs were stained with TotalSeq-C antibodies (Biolegend, 99814) according to manufacturer's instructions. After incubating with 0.5 vial of TotalSeq-C for 30 min at 4 \u00ac\u221eC, PBMCs were washed three times by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min at 4 \u00ac\u221eC. PBMCs were counted again and processed immediately for 10x 5' single cell capture (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kit v1.1 with Feature Barcoding technology for cell Surface Protein-Rev D protocol). Two lanes of 25,000 cells were loaded per pool on a 10x chip. Gene expression, TCR enriched and BCR enriched libraries were prepared for each sample according to the manufacturer's protocol (10x Genomics). Cell surface protein libraries were subjected to double the manufacturer's recommended primer concentration and 8 amplification cycles during the sample index PCR to reduce the likelihood of daisy chains forming. Libraries were pooled per patient using the following ratio 6:2:1:1 for gene expression, cell surface protein, TCR enriched and BCR enriched libraries.",
