        "protocol_description": "Subjects 18 years and older were included from two large hospital sites in London, United Kingdom, namely University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust during the height of the pandemic in the United Kingdom (April to July 2020). Ethical approval was given through the Living Airway Biobank, administered through UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health (REC reference: 19/NW/0171, IRAS project ID 261511), as well as by the local R&D departments at both hospitals. At daily virtual COVID-19 co-ordination meetings suitable patients were chosen from a list of newly diagnosed and admitted patients within the preceding 24 h (based on a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2). Patients with typical clinical and radiological COVID-19 features but with a negative screening test for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded. Other excluding criteria included active haematological malignancy or cancer, known immunodeficiencies, sepsis from any cause and blood transfusion within 4 weeks. Maximal severity of COVID-19 was determined retrospectively by determining the presence of symptoms, the need of oxygen supplementation and the level of respiratory support. Peripheral blood sampling was performed prior to inclusion to any pharmacological interventional trials.\n\nSamples were collected and transferred to a Category Level 3 facility at University College London and processed within 2 h of sample collection. Peripheral blood was centrifuged after adding Ficoll Paque Plus and PBMCs, serum and neutrophils separated, collected and frozen for later processing.",
