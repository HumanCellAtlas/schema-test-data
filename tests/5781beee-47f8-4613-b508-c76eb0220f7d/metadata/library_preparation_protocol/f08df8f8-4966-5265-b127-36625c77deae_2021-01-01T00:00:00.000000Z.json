The cells were then stained with the custom panel Total-seq C (Biolegend 99813) for 30 minutes at 4\u02daC. Cells were then washed twice with PBS supplemented with 2% (v/v) FCS and 2mM EDTA (Sigma) before resuspending in PBS and counting. 20,000-30,000 cells per sample were loaded onto the 10x Chromium controller using Chromium NextGEM Single Cell V(D)J Reagent kits v1.1 with Feature Barcoding technology for Cell Surface Protein (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gene expression, TCR enriched and BCR enriched libraries were prepared for each sample according to the manufacturer's protocol (10x Genomics). Cell surface protein libraries were subjected to double the manufacturer's recommended primer concentration and 8 amplification cycles during the sample index PCR to reduce the likelihood of daisy chains forming. Libraries were pooled per patient using the following ratio 6:2:1:1 for gene expression, cell surface protein, TCR enriched and BCR enriched libraries.",
