For the IV-LPS control samples: LPS was obtained from Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin (Lots 94332B1 donated by National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) and injected intravenously as a bolus dose of 2 ng/kg. Blood samples were taken prior to IV LPS administration (baseline) and at 90 min, and 10 h post challenge. Venous blood was drawn from an 18g venous cannula and was collected into EDTA and serum separator tubes. Only samples from 90 min and 10 h were analysed in this study.",
