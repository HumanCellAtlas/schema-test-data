For the IV-LPS control samples: LPS was obtained from Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin (Lots 94332B1 donated by National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) and injected intravenously as a bolus dose of 2 ng/kg. Blood samples were taken prior to IV LPS administration (baseline) and at 90 min, and 10 h post challenge. Venous blood was drawn from an 18g venous cannula and was collected into EDTA and serum separator tubes. Only samples from 90 min and 10 h were analysed in this study."}, "method": {"text": "blood draw", "ontology": "EFO:0009121", "ontology_label": "blood draw"}, "provenance": {"document_id": "efe5fd2b-f71f-4e20-aec2-d2941cc13de9", "submission_date": "2021-03-23T15:24:37.287Z", "update_date": "2021-03-23T15:24:44.809Z", "schema_major_version": 9, "schema_minor_version": 2}}
