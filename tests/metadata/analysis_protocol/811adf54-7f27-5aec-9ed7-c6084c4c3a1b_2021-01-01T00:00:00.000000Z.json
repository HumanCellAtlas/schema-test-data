        "protocol_description": "Newcastle: Scrublet (v0.2.1) was applied to each sample to generate a doublet score. These formed a bimodal distribution so the tool's automatic threshold was applied.  Cambridge: Non-empty droplets were called within each multiplexed pool of donors using the emptyDrops function implemented in the Bioconductor package DropletUtils, using a UMI threshold of 100 and FDR of 1%. The probability of being a doublet was estimated for each cell per sample (that is one 10x lane) using the \"doubletCells\" function in scran based on highly variable genes (HVGs). Next, we used \"cluster_walktrap\" on the SNN-Graph that was computed on HVGs to form highly resolved clusters per sample. Per-sample clusters with either a median doublet score greater than the median + 2.5 x MAD or clusters containing more than the median + 2.5 MAD genotype doublets were tagged as doublets. This was followed by a second round of highly-resolved clustering across the whole data set, in which again cells belonging to clusters with a high proportion (> 60%) of cells previously labelled as doublets were also defined as doublets.  UCL/Sanger: For pooled donor CITE-seq samples, the donor ID of each cell was determined by genotype-based demultiplexing using souporcell version 2. Souporcell analyses were performed with 'skip_remap' enabled and a set of known donor genotypes given under the 'common_variants' parameter. The donor ID of each souporcell genotype cluster was annotated by comparing each souporcell genotype to the set of known genotypes. Droplets that contained more than one genotype according to souporcell were flagged as 'ground-truth' doublets for heterotypic doublet identification. Ground-truth doublets were used by DoubletFinder 2.0.3 to empirically determine an optimal 'pK' value for doublet detection. DoubletFinder analysis was performed on each sample separately using 10 principal components, a 'pN' value of 0.25, and the 'nExp' parameter estimated from the fraction of ground-truth doublets and the number of pooled donors.  Combined raw data from the three centres was filtered to remove those that expressed fewer than 200 genes and >10% mitochondrial reads. Data was normalised (scanpy: normalize_total), log+1 corrected (scanpy: log1p) and highly variable genes identified using the Seurat vst algorithm (scanpy: highly_variable_genes). Harmony was used to adjust principal components by sample ID and used to generate the neighbourhood graph and embedded using UMAP. Clustering was performed using the Leiden algorithm with an initial resolution of 3. For initial clustering, differentially expressed genes were calculated using Wilcoxon rank-sum test.",
