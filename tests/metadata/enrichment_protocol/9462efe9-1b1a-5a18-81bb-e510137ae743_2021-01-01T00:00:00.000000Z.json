Single cell suspensions were then washed with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS)(Sigma) and frozen in 5-10 million cell aliquots in 90% (v/v) heat inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (Gibco) 10% (v/v) DMSO (Sigma Aldrich). On the day of the experiment the cells were thawed for 1 minute, transferred to Wash buffer (PBS supplemented with 2% (v/v) FCS and 2mM EDTA), and centrifuged at 500g  for 5 minutes.",
