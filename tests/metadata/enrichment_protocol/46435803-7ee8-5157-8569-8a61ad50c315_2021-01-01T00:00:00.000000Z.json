        "protocol_description": "Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using Leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-One) with Histopaque 1077 (Sigma) by centrifugation at 800x g for 15 minutes at room temperature. PBMCs at the interface were collected, rinsed twice with autoMACS running buffer (Miltenyi Biotech) and cryopreserved in FBS with 10% DMSO. All samples were processed within 4 hours of collection. Purified PBMCs were thawed at 37oC, transferred to a 50 mL tube and 10 volumes of pre-warmed thawing media (IMDM (Gibco 12440-053) with 50% (v/v) FCS (not heat inactivated;  Panbiotech P40-37500) and 0.1 mg/ml DNaseI (Worthington LS002139)) were added slowly and dropwise, followed by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of FACS buffer (PBS (Sigma D8537)  with 3% (v/v) heat-inactivated FCS) and viability of each sample was assessed by counting in an improved Neubauer chamber using Trypan blue. Pools of 4 samples were generated by combining 0.5 million live cells per individual (2 million live cells total). The pools were washed twice in FACS buffer (10 mL and 2 mL, respectively) followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 g. The pellet was then resuspended in 35 \u0152\u00bal of FACS buffer and the viability of each pool was assessed.",
